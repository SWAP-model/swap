  abstract = {This report describes a soil nitrogen module (Soil-N), which is combined with the agro-hydrological model, SWAP, and the crop growth model, WOFOST. The core of the Soil-N module is a description of the nitrogen cycle, which is coupled to the organic matter cycle based upon the RothC-26.3 model. Nitrogen can be supplied to the soil as different types of fertilizer applications and through mineralisation of organic nitrogen. Ammonium and nitrate balances are calculated including uptake by plant roots, de-nitrification and leaching of nitrate. Data exchange is on a daily base. The partitioning of nitrogen within crops and the nitrogen contents of crop residues are calculated by WOFOST and passed to the Soil-N module. SWAP generates the data for establishing the water balance of the soil compartment for which the Soil-N perform the simulations. Nitrogen uptake by the crop is calculated as the minimum of the demand by the crop and the availability of nitrogen in the soil. The crop production rate is reduced when the mineral nitrogen stock is limited. Nitrogen-fixation is based on a simple approach. An improved sub-model for phenological stages of soybean was implemented. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations can be accounted for. The innovated integrated model was tested using data sets from The Netherlands, China and Argentina, for which examples are given. This new model can be used as a tool in studies, in which both water and nitrogen can be limited for crop growth.},

  abstract = {This paper highlights the evolution and impact of the SWAP model (Soil -- Water -- Atmosphere -- Plant), which was initiated by R.A. Feddes and colleagues fifty years ago, in 1974. Since then, the SWAP model has played a crucial role in the advancement of agrohydrology. This paper highlights some major advances that have been made, especially focussing on the last fifteen years. The domain of the SWAP model deals with the simulation of the soil water balance in both unsaturated and saturated conditions. The model solves the Richards equation using the water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions as described by the Van Genuchten -- Mualem equations. Bimodal extensions of the Van Genuchten - Mualem relationships have been implemented, as well as modifications near saturation and addressing hysteresis. An important sink term in the Richards equation is root water uptake. Crop development plays an important role in a robust simulation of root water uptake. That is why a link has been made with the dynamic crop growth model WOFOST. Instead of using a prescribed crop development, a distinction between potential and actual crop development is calculated by reducing the potential photosynthesis as a result of water or oxygen stress. Since the early days of SWAP, empirical and macroscopic concepts have been used to simulate root water uptake. Recently two process-based concepts of root water uptake and oxygen stress have also been implemented. Another important sink-source term in the Richards equation is the interaction with artificial drains. In SWAP, drainage can be simulated by either using prescribed or simulated drain heads and simulation of controlled drainage with subirrigation is possible. Finally, we briefly elaborate on three studies using SWAP: water stresses in agriculture in the Netherlands, regional water productivity in China, and controlled drainage with subirrigation. We finish discussing promising developments for the near future.},

Modelling of the processes in the vadose zone helps to understand and quantify effects of, for example, land use, irrigation, salinity and climate changes. Version 2 of SWAP (soil--water--atmosphere--plant) is a numerical model that simulates the (interaction between) one-dimensional soil moisture, heat and solute transport in the topsoil layers. The influence of all these processes on crop growth may be simulated as well. This article describes briefly some of the options the program offers. The results of a sensitivity analysis are discussed, followed by a case study on variations in soil salinity in a coastal area. Copyright {\copyright} 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Special features of the model are generic crop growth, versatile top boundary conditions, macroporous flow, and interaction of soil water with groundwater and surface water. We discuss typical model applications that have appeared in recent scientific literature. New model developments are explained with respect to the numerical solution of Richards' equation, macroporous flow, evapotranspiration, and interactions with groundwater and surface water. We describe case studies on agricultural water productivity, regional nutrient management, and groundwater conservation by surface water management. Finally we envision model developments with respect to SWAP for the coming 5 to 10 yr.},
